## About Me

Hi, this is Yinghao Tang(唐英豪). I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at Zhejiang University under the supervision of [Prof. Wei Chen](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/chenwei/) in [VAI group](https://zjuvag.org/). Before that, I received my B.Eng. degree from Sichuan University, where I was advised by Prof. [Mingjie Tang](https://merlintang.github.io/) in [IDS lab](https://ids-lab-asia.github.io/). My research interests include MLsys, LLM training and visualization.
