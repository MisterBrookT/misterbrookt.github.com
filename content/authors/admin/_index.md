    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

Hi, this is Yinghao Tang(唐英豪). I am currently a Ph.D. student in Computer Engineering at Zhejiang University under the supervision of Prof. Wei Chen in VAI group. Before that, I received my B.Eng. degree from Sichuan University, where I was advised by Prof. Mingjie Tang in IDS lab. My research interests include MLsys, LLM training and visualization.
